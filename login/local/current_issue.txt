1, Add omniactl login command
This command should log into the authorization provider 
(e.g. GItHub) and get an OAuth token for use by subsequent commands.  It should then write this token, with any necessary additional info, to a file e.g. ~/.omniactl-auth (or if the format is amenable, add it to the ~/omniactl ini file).  If there is an expiry, that should be recorded also.
I'm assuming i understand how OAuth works, 
so if this plan seems crazy once you look into it, we should revisit.

Example with command prompt
% omniactl login
username: e650101
password: **********
Successfully logged in.  Your login with expire at 16:48:23Z Feb 28 2019.

Example with flags
% omniactl login --username e650101 --password clearpassword
Login failed.


2, Add help flag for config package
